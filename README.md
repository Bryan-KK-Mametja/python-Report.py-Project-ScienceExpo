This Python code is designed to perform efficient and comprehensive data analysis, catering to a variety of data types, including numerical, categorical, and time series data. It leverages popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, manipulate, and visualize datasets, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and insight generation.

Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading data from various sources, such as Excel. It automatically handles missing values, converts data types, and normalizes data when required.

Data Exploration: It provides tools to understand the structure of the dataset, including functions to check the shape of the data, view summary statistics, and detect correlations among variables.

Data Cleaning: The code identifies and deals with missing or inconsistent data, handles outliers, and normalizes or scales numerical columns, ensuring that the data is ready for analysis.

Visualization: Using Matplotlib, the code generates a variety of visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps. These plots help users to gain insights into data distribution, relationships, and patterns.

Statistical Analysis: For deeper insights, the code includes basic statistical tests, such as t-tests, chi-square tests, and correlation coefficients, to help assess data relationships and hypothesis testing.

Data Export: Once analysis is complete, the code supports exporting cleaned and processed data into new files for further use or reporting.
